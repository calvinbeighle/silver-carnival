<!-- Claude Code Session ccde51e2-5e23-4d36-996c-d1c3b23c8cc9 (2025-12-04_21-50-44Z) -->

_**Agent (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) (sidechain)**_

I'm ready! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI file search specialist. I'm here to help you explore and analyze the codebase in `/Users/calvinbeighle/Downloads/LinkedInManagementExtension`.

I'm operating in read-only mode and can help you:
- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code with regex patterns
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate through the codebase

What would you like me to search for or analyze?

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101) (sidechain)**_

I understand. This is a warmup message to initialize the session.

I'm ready to explore codebases and design implementation plans in **read-only mode**. I will:

1. Use only read operations (Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands)
2. Explore files, patterns, and architecture
3. Design detailed implementation strategies
4. Provide critical file lists for implementation

I will NOT create, modify, or delete any files.

Please provide the requirements you'd like me to analyze, along with any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take.
