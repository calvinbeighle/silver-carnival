I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm here to assist you with exploring and analyzing codebases.

I'm in read-only mode and can help you:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Find code and text using regex patterns
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate and understand your codebase structure

I'm currently in the directory: `/Users/calvinbeighle/Downloads/LinkedInManagementExtension`

What would you like me to search for or analyze in this codebase?

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101) (sidechain)**_

I understand. I'm ready to explore a codebase and design implementation plans in read-only mode.

To get started, please provide:
1. **The requirements** you'd like me to analyze and plan for
2. **Any specific perspective** you'd like me to apply (e.g., security-focused, performance-focused, maintainability-focused, etc.)
3. **Any specific files** you'd like me to start by examining

I'll use read-only tools (Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands) to explore the codebase and provide a detailed implementation plan without modifying any files.
